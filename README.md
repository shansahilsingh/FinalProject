# Introduction
Our Education Business Website is designed to facilitate the seamless exchange of educational resources, information, and services. This project leverages Microsoft Azure services to provide a robust and scalable infrastructure.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
Azure account with appropriate permissions.
Azure CLI installed.
GitHub account for source control.
# Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine: https://github.com/shansahilsingh/FinalProject
Navigate to the project directory: https://purple-river-0e92e5410.3.azurestaticapps.net/
# Configuration
Before deploying the website, you need to configure the application settings, environment variables, and other settings as required. These configurations are typically stored in a .env file or within your Azure Static Web App and Azure App Service configurations.

# Deployment
# Static Web App
Azure Static Web Apps is a fully managed service that enables you to build, deploy, and scale static web apps with ease.

Set up a Static Web App in Azure using the Azure portal. Connect it to your GitHub repository.

Configure your build and deployment settings as needed. Typically, you will specify the build directory and branch to deploy from.

Azure will automatically build and deploy your website when you push changes to the specified branch in your GitHub repository.

# Azure App Service
Azure App Service is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering for building, deploying, and scaling web apps.

Set up an Azure App Service in the Azure portal.

Configure your App Service with the necessary runtime and settings. You can deploy your website code using Git, FTP, or other deployment methods supported by Azure App Service.

Once deployed, your website will be accessible via the URL provided by Azure App Service.
